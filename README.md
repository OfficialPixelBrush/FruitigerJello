# FruitigerJello
A modernized Frutiger Aero inspired Icon Theme.

# Core Ideas
Icons should look tasty again.
If I don't want to put an icon into my mouth, its failed as an icon.
It should welcome me into my glorious computer world.

# How to install
Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OfficialPixelBrush/FruitigerJello.git
cd FruitigerJello
```

Run `prep_release.sh`
```bash
chmod +x prep_release.sh
./prep_release.sh
```

Copy it to your icons directory
```bash
cp -r FruitigerJello ~/.local/share/icons
```

And you're set!
